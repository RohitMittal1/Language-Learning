    <u><h1>Peculiar Features</h1></u>
    <p>Since Italian has been derived from Vulgar Latin, it is not a difficult language to learn. The Italian alphabet comprises of 21 letters. The letters –j-, -k-, -w-, -x-, -y- are not present in the alphabet and can be met only in the words adopted from other languages, for example, jeans, taxi, whiskey. Gemination (length) is a peculiar feature of Italian consonants, which significantly changes the meaning of the word: casa – house, while cassa – box; nono – ninth, while nonno – grandfather.
        <br>
       <p>Nouns are of two genders: masculine and feminine. The ending for masculine nouns is -o, and for feminine is -a (ragazzo – boy, while ragazza – girl). The position of the verb is not strictly defined in the sentence, it’s highly mobile. Stress is also variable and can be used in any syllable in the word. Pronunciation is simple, as the sounds of the letters are fixed. In addition, a lot of words with English roots are present: positive – positive, necessary – necessario.

    <u><h1>Peculiar Features</h1></u>
    <p>Japanese is unique, as it is not tonal unlike other Asian languages. It is important to note that there are four systems of writing that Japanese uses: Kanji (it is based on the Chinese writing system), Hiragana (it is used for conjugations, particles simple words, and children’s literature), Katakana (it is used to write foreign words), and Romanji (it is used to simplify the original letters). Many words have two roots of pronunciation: one – Japanese and the other – Chinese, and they sound totally different. So, Japanese is almost like learning the vocabulary of 2 languages at once. One more thing that can drive you crazy is a large number of homophones (the words are pronounced the same but they mean different things). For example, God, true, heart, new, parent, stretch, to advance, to believe – all these words are pronounced ‘shin’ but, as you can see, mean totally different things.
        <p>The relief to the Japanese learners: verbs aren’t conjugated for number or person, so you shouldn’t memorize tons of derivatives if you have learned the base verb once. In addition, verbs are usually placed at the end of the sentence.
